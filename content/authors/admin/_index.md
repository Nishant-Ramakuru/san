Greetings to my website Folks!


[University of Bristol, UK](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/)[Designing Considerate Swarms](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2021/33/86/102901) in MIT press, at the ALIFE 2021. Prior to this I worked as a Robotics Engineer at [HALCON](https://halcon.ae/) and as a Machine Learning Engineer at [ALGO8](https://algo8.ai/) after passing out from the International Institute Of Information Technology, Pune, with a BEng in Electronics.
